### Headings

Similar to HTML, '# h1' is the highest level and '###### h6' is the lowest.
<br>
Increasing the number of '#' symbols creates lower level headings.

<br>

# h1

## h2

### h3

### Paragraph

For standard text like this, simply start typing. To create a new line or paragraph, just hit return for a line break.

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### Blockquote

To highlight a quote or important point, use the '>' symbol at the start of a line.
<br><br>

> Text that is a quote

<br>

### Code blocks

Show off your code snippets inside three backticks '```'.<br>
You can specify the programming language after the first three backticks for syntax highlighting.
<br><br>

```javascript
const example = () => {
  console.log("This is an example of a code block.");
};
```

### Unordered Lists

Jot down your points in an unordered list. Begin each line with a '+' or '-' or '\*'.

- Point two
- Point three

### Ordered Lists

When sequence matters, use an ordered list. Just type the number followed by a period and space.

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three
